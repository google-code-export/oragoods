#summary How to create and user your own data sources

= Introduction =

Now have now installed and tested the GDataSource package. You now want to add your own DataSources to query.


= Adding your DataSources =

The schema.sql file creates a table (gdatasources). In order to use your own datasources you just need to insert new ones in this table. For example, for a list of employees names:

<code>
insert into gdatasources values ('emp-names','select first_name, last_name from hr.employees');
commit;
</code>

Then just call the datasource by it's name: http://your-db-server:8080/your_dad/gdatasource.get_json?p_datasource_id=emp-names

You can also filter using the Google Query Language: http://your-db-server:8080/your_dad/gdatasource.get_json?p_datasource_id=emp-names&tq=select%20first_name%20where%20last_name%20%3D%20%22tiger%22

Here we encoded tq with the encodeURIComponent() javascript function. tq actually is: <b>select first_name where last_name = "tiger"</b>
